## Cumul8 Tech Test - Johnny Ji

This project is my take on the Cumul8 tech test. You'll notice that I've purposely made some design decision as well as added some features to the app, but the core application behaviours are still fulfilled.

Please let me know if you have any questions at all!


### How to open the app

1. Go to `./dist/index.html`
2. Drag the `index.html` file into your browser

OR

1. run `npm install` in the command line
2. run `npm run dev-server` in the command line
3. visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser


### Tech Stack

- React.js (Because it's awesome)
- Reflux (Flux framework)
- ES6
- Webpack
- SASS


I hope you enjoy! Please feel free to reach out to me at johnny@johnnyji.com.

Best,



**Johnny**
